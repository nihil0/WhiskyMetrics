**Review #59: 1792 Port Finish**

I tried the original 1792 early in my exploration of bourbon.  It left me highly disappointed.  It was like a blander, slighter hotter Buffalo Trace.  I almost gave it another go tonight, but decided to just stick with this port finished version.  I’ve been out the review writing game for a while, but I’ve kept up on experiencing the content.
This is from Barton, 6 years or so I have read but the bottle says “many” years in new white oak before finishing for a 2 more years in used port barrels.  It has an ugly fake gold top and the way “1792” is printed is stupid.  Why is each number a different size? I’m a sucker for port finished things though so let’s see how this one does.  I bought this tonight, $42 American Imperial Credits of the Realm.  Almost went for the $11 bottle of Mellow Corn instead, or in addition.  There is always next weekend.     

**44.45% ABV**

* **Appearance:**  Tears take a while to form and get thick and take their sweet time rolling down the glass.  Color is amberish but not that dark or Port colored. 

* **Nose:**  Spicy Sweetness typical of Port finishing, cloves, raisins are front and center, some citrus and coconut comes through once the spice dissipates a bit.  Nice toasty oak overall along with vanilla AND chocolate!  It’s a twist cone.  It’s a nice sweet nose 

* **Taste:**  More bitter than I expect from the nose.  There is young/green oak, dark chocolate, hazelnuts, raspberries, and some pepper.  The sweet and bitter elements are a bit at odds.  Thin but oily mouthfeel.   
    
* **Finish:**  Short, weak, dry, but pleasant while it lasts.

Well, this was fine for $40 and honestly a nice change of pace from more standard fair.  That being said while there isn’t anything majorly wrong with it I found the nose a touch sweeter than I usually like and the taste a bit of a mess.  The port doesn’t help much and may be better suited for finishing rye and scotch.  The slightly high rye content (15% ?) of this bourbon gave me hope…

Again, certainly not bad, but I was hoping for more.  If you like a sweet nose you will love this.

**76/100**
