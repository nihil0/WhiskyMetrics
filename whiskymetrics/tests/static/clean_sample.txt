review 59 1792 port finish

i tried the original 1792 early in my exploration of bourbon  it left me highly disappointed  it was like a blander slighter hotter buffalo trace  i almost gave it another go tonight but decided to just stick with this port finished version  ive been out the review writing game for a while but ive kept up on experiencing the content
this is from barton 6 years or so i have read but the bottle says many years in new white oak before finishing for a 2 more years in used port barrels  it has an ugly fake gold top and the way 1792 is printed is stupid  why is each number a different size im a sucker for port finished things though so lets see how this one does  i bought this tonight 42 american imperial credits of the realm  almost went for the 11 bottle of mellow corn instead or in addition  there is always next weekend

 appearance  tears take a while to form and get thick and take their sweet time rolling down the glass  color is amberish but not that dark or port colored 

 nose  spicy sweetness typical of port finishing cloves raisins are front and center some citrus and coconut comes through once the spice dissipates a bit  nice toasty oak overall along with vanilla and chocolate  its a twist cone  its a nice sweet nose 

 taste  more bitter than i expect from the nose  there is younggreen oak dark chocolate hazelnuts raspberries and some pepper  the sweet and bitter elements are a bit at odds  thin but oily mouthfeel   
    
 finish  short weak dry but pleasant while it lasts

well this was fine for 40 and honestly a nice change of pace from more standard fair  that being said while there isnt anything majorly wrong with it i found the nose a touch sweeter than i usually like and the taste a bit of a mess  the port doesnt help much and may be better suited for finishing rye and scotch  the slightly high rye content 15  of this bourbon gave me hope

again certainly not bad but i was hoping for more  if you like a sweet nose you will love this
