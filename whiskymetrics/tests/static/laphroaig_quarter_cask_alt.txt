music leif vollebekk north americana released 2013

weather rain fog and 10 degrees  perfect islay whisky weather

ob laphroaig 18 year old  48 bottled in 2012

colour same as above
nose 
neat   much more subdued than the qc sweeter and rounded background notes that remind me of tiger balm
watered  with this one the water definitely opens up the drink more mustiness and peat and some nice minerality appears 
palate 
neat  salty and drops of iodine while the nose was sweeter than the qc its a more dry drink definitely feel the oak in the back of the throat 
water  i like it at hlfsterkur better everything seems to open up the initial flavours seem more defined more marine notes appear definitely get more of the smoke particularly as you start to drinkinhale at the same time you can almost feel it drifting down the back of your throat i picture this fhnhttppixavaxnewscomavaxnewse0e40000e4e0jpeg
finish citrus pithy and longer then the qc 
arbitary grading b
buy again no particularly when you factor in the price 

ob laphroaig quarter cask  48 one of the newer releases of qc

 colour reminds me of an oaked chardonnay
 nose 
neat  sweet light diesel kind of like when i pumped boat gas at the marina for the summer plus my favourite serge descriptor wet dogs a little tar and what i think coal would smell like with time the smoke appears
watered  not much difference more earthinesspeat shows up but it seems more muted which i think is odd doesnt water release the esters and volatiles
 palate 
neat  bready vanilla wood spicy pretty simple but direct and enjoyable
water  again quite similar some bitterness makes an appearance not so great
 finish sharp and quick 
 arbitary grading b
 buy again yes particularly when you factor in the price

i dont care much about colour other than not wanting spirit caramel in my drinks however its interesting that with at least 8  10 years between these two they are identical in hue very drinkable  fullsterkur and doesnt benefit from water 


i liked the punch and the freshness of the qc more than the oak influenced 18 year old and as noted when you line them up dollars to dollars its an easy choice for future purchases i did find it interesting the marked difference between the two when came to adding water with the 18 becoming a much more interesting drink with water added
