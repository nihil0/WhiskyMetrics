This is a project to build a command line tool that gets from [r/Scotch](reddit.com/r/scotch) all reviews of a certain Scotch distillery, whisky or whisky producing region.

The ultimate goal of the project is to build a map of single malt Scotch whiskies based on performing some very advanced analytics on review datasets.
